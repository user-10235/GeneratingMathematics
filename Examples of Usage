In these examples, numbers will be used to denote different variables. There variables are not to be taken as a numerical order.

0, "1"
(0,0) --> 1, "1 + 1 = 2"
(0,1) --> 2, "1 + 2 = 3"
(0,2) --> 3, "1 + 3 = 4"
...
(0,n) --> n+1, "1 + (n+1) = (n+2)"

If this was to continue going, these rules would generate all positive integers. Addition by one can be recreated using these rules and represent all positive integers. Subtrsction can also be recreated using computation. The next exmple will show negative integers.
