# Generating Mathematics

This repository will introduce a conjecture that can potentially be used to generate mathematics. Many examples of math generation will be given as evidence for the conjecture. Potentially this conjecture can be used to generate "pure" mathematics (meaning that it is not appied) for many cases. All concepts that are recreated in this repository using the rules based on this conjecture are evidence for the conjecture with no counterexample (up to this point).

(This is a work in progress.)

Conjecture - Everything is defined as a mathematical structure as follows:

and there are no logical operators in the conjecture and can not be constructed with these rules since it is assumed that the structure of everything is true (or false if the conjecture is disproven). Since it is assumed that the building blocks of mathematics are true, everything that is built from them must be true and can not be assigned a truth value other than true. Logical operators can be constructed in some sense, but they can only prove or disprove statements.

Constructing different axioms using this conjecture is a step forward to proving the conjecture. Feel free to test the conjecture and recreate different concepts.
