# Generating Mathematics using Copmputations

This repository will introduce a conjecture that can potentially be used to generate mathematics. Many examples of math generation will be given as evidence for the conjecture. Potentially this conjecture can be used to generate "pure" mathematics (meaning that it is not appied) for many cases. All theorems that are recreated in this repository using the rules based on this conjecture are evidence for the conjecture with no counterexample (to this point).
