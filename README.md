# Generating Mathematics

This repository will introduce a conjecture that can potentially be used to generate mathematics. Many examples of math generation will be given as evidence for the conjecture. Potentially this conjecture can be used to generate "pure" mathematics (meaning that it is not appied) for many cases. All concepts that are recreated in this repository using the rules based on this conjecture are evidence for the conjecture with no counterexample (up to this point).

(This is a work in progress.)

Conjecture - Everything is defined as a mathematical structure as follows:

and there are no logical operators in the conjecture and can not be constructed since it is assumed that the structure of everything is ture (or false if the conjecture is disproven). Constructing different axioms using this conjecture is a step forward to proving this conjecture.

Feel free to test the conjecture and recreate different concepts.
