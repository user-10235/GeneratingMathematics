# Generating Mathematics using Copmputations

This repository will introduce a conjecture that can potentially be used to generate mathematics. Many examples of math generation will be given as evidence for the conjecture. Potentially this conjecture can be used to generate "pure" mathematics (meaning that it is not appied) for many cases.
